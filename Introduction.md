My name is Lorenzo Martinez and welcome to my repository. My life philosophy is to always evolve as a person each day, even if it is just 1% better. I am never satisfied with being good because I know there is always room for improvement. This mindset has fueled my passion for business and data analytics. With Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Computer Science and over three years of professional experience as a data analyst, I am eager to find opportunities to evolve as a professional.
